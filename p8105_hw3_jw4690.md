``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

``` r
ny_noaa_df = ny_noaa |>
  filter(!is.na(date),
         !is.na(tmax),
         !is.na(tmin)) |>
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date)) |>
  mutate(tmin = as.numeric(tmin) / 10,
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax) / 10)
```

``` r
# find the most commonly observed values for snowfall

snowfall_counts = ny_noaa_df |>
  count(snow, name = "n_obs")

common_snowfall = snowfall_counts |>
  filter(n_obs == max(n_obs))
```

The most commonly observed values for snowfall is 0. I think itâ€™s
because snowfall only occurs during certain month, while for much of the
year, no snow is recorded, and even during winter month, many days may
still have no snowfall.
